My ***really late*** attempt to solve [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)

Install dependencies to run the code

```sh
pnpm install
```

# [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1)

> 2025-01-09 (~30m)

## Part 1

```sh
pnpm day1_1
#> 1889772
```

## Part 2

```sh
pnpm day1_2
#> 23228917
```

# [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2)

> 2025-01-10 (~1h30m)

## Part 1

```sh
pnpm day2_1
#> 660
```

## Part 2

Brute forcing, I'm not proud of it, but it's not that bad.

```sh
pnpm day2_2
#> 689
```

# [Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/3)

> 2025-01-13 (~30m)

Well I prompted my AI to generate the regex. Who write their own regex anyway?

## Part 1

```sh
pnpm day3_1
#> 174561379
```

## Part 2

```sh
pnpm day3_2
#> 106921067
```

# [Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/4)

> 2025-01-14 (~...m)

## Part 1

The logic might be right, but the comments are probably wrong.

```sh
pnpm day4_1
#> 2567
```

## Part 2

A lot of hard coded logic, I guess I was just bored in the middle of the solution.

```sh
pnpm day4_2
#> 2029
```
